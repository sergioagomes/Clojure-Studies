- **Today`s Progress**: Today I started a Clojure formation on Alura, so the first class I saw about the syntax of language, and how to define symbols that are similar to global variables in other languages, also saw a bit about immutability.

## Day 2: SEP 19, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept watching the clojure course, so in this class I learn about how can I create my functions using the key **defn**, and how pass parameters, and to finalize I saw about patterns to write code on clojure.

## Day 3: SEP 20, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept my studies with clojure, I learn how to define global and local symbols and  see your differences, besides that I say about how to use let to define more than one symbol and conditionals.

## Day 4: SEP 21, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept my progress with clojure, first a learned about leiningen, that is a tool to build projects in closure of easy way, besides that I learn more about function, like predicate, high-order-functions and anonymous functions, also started a simple project using the leiningen to pratice what I saw on formation.

## Day 5: SEP 22, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept my progress with clojure, learned more about vectors and how use get to get the value of vector and update is a function that applies a function a vector in the indice passing as parameter, and returns that vector with the values update, I also started programming clojure book. to go deep
in the language.

## Day 6: SEP 25, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I learned about some important functions on clojure that are map, filter and reduce and how just tree function we can do a lot of things, also kept my read of book programing clojure, learn about forms and keywords to use theses things to improve our code.

## Day 7: SEP 26, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept me reading  the book programing clojure, It is a great book to get the foundation of  clojure, Because I learn more about functions, reader macros, things that I haven't seen, also practice a little, testing do some functions with map, filter e reduce to memorize in my head.

## Day 8: SEP 27, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I practice a little about how define maps/dictionaries and did some to fix in my mind.

## Day 9: SEP 28, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I studie about thread(first and last) in clojure, in which case use each one, and learned about destructuring, and how these helps when we want extract the value to individual variables in one step.This technique is particularly useful when you want to conveniently access specific parts of a complex data structure.

Destructuring is often used in function parameters, where you can destructure the arguments passed to the function to access the values ​​directly. Additionally, it is commonly used in maps to extract values ​​associated with specific keys.

## Day 10: SEP 29, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I just studied kept my read of programming clojure, fixing somethings doing examples on practice.

- **Link to Description**: [Programming-Clojure](/logs/Docs/Programming-Clojure.md)


## Day 11: OCT 02, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept watching the Alura course, so I saw how create maps and use recursion with them, and put in practice what I saw in class in a new project **Store**, also still read the programming clojure book.

- **Link to Description**: [Classes](/logs/Projects/store/src/store/classs2.clj)


## Day 12: OCT 03, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I learned about recursion and how to use in clojure to avoid  stack overflow, also about tail recursion, this means that recursion is call as the last operation of the function before returing a value, and saw how to do multiple variables of the same function per arity, and to finish saw about loops and how I can implement to.

- **Link to Description**: [Classes](/logs/Projects/store/src/store/classs3.clj)



## Day 13: OCT 04, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I watched one more class on Alura about grouping maps and how to work with that, also learn how to simulate a database in memory, use required to import a class of another file and use as to abreviate,  I still had some difficultie to understand totaly this clas so I will practice more, doing more maps and groupings and watch the video again and looking for another examples to fix in my head.

- **Link to Description**: [Classes](/logs/Projects/store/src/store/class4.clj)


## Day 14: OCT 05, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today was a short day, just read another cap of the book progamming in Clojure and watched a video on youtube about to do a WEB API in clojure.

- **Link to Description**: [Book](/logs/Docs/Programming-Clojure.md)

## Day 15: OCT 06, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today was a short day, just read another chapter of the book, in this chapter I learned about side effects, recursion and loops, metadata and reader metadata, as the Author said in the final of cap, now I can write some basic code and that is what I'll do.


- **Link to Description**: [Book](/logs/Docs/Programming-Clojure.md)



## Day 16: OCT 07, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I still the course Clojure of Alura, learned about how order elements and use some functions to take with elements like: get, nth, reverse, take, some, also I tried to do some exercise of HeartOtber in clojure.


- **Link to Description**: [Book](/logs/Projects/store/)


## Day 17: OCT 09, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I just read how to configure a clojure project in leinigen, to put dependencies, the start point and other things...


- **References**:[github]()

## Day 18: OCT 10, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I finish the second course of formation Clojure on Alura, I learned about keep function, what it's the purpose and how this function is look a map/reduce functions, also learn about Lazy and Eaeger in Clojure and how can I use each one.

- **Link to Description**: [Clojure-Alura](/logs/Docs/Clojure-Alura.md)

## Day 19: OCT 11, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I started a new cap in the book programming Clojure, learned more about data structures and as in Clojure we can see the most data structures as sequences, also read more about lazy/eager and saw some examples to get the idea.


## Day 20: OCT 12, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I watched the video **Build a real world Clojure application**, because I want do some application with Clojure, so I started a todo-list project to practice and also will start a project real-word to do with the videos.


## Day 21: OCT 17, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I started the project real-world-app, where I'll try making my app on clojure with base in the videos... I also started the third course of the Clojure Formation of Alura, in the first class I saw about vectors|lists|sets and learned about Queues and how to declare one.

## Day 22: OCT 18, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept the Alura course, did implementations about queue with base class, but I took some time did alone to make equal the professor did, also read more of book - programming clojure.

## Day 23: OCT 19, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I leanerd more about how to work with Queues and  workin a litlle in real-world-app (will be a simple todo-list api) but it's weird do project withou leiningen.

## Day 26: OCT 23, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept do the real world app, learned about how to configure a pedestal and component librarie, but still also read more about these libraries to understand 100%, and I watched more classes about Clojure formation in Alura, saw about threads and their problems and how bad is use global sysmbols.
