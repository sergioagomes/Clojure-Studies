## Day 1: SEP 18, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I started a Clojure formation on Alura, so the first class I saw about the syntax of language, and how to define symbols that are similar to global variables in other languages, also saw a bit about immutability.

## Day 2: SEP 19, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept watching the clojure course, so in this class I learn about how can I create my functions using the key **defn**, and how pass parameters, and to finalize I saw about patterns to write code on clojure.

## Day 3: SEP 20, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept my studies with clojure, I learn how to define global and local symbols and  see your differences, besides that I say about how to use let to define more than one symbol and conditionals.

## Day 4: SEP 21, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept my progress with clojure, first a learned about leiningen, that is a tool to build projects in closure of easy way, besides that I learn more about function, like predicate, high-order-functions and anonymous functions, also started a simple project using the leiningen to pratice what I saw on formation.

## Day 5: SEP 22, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept my progress with clojure, learned more about vectors and how use get to get the value of vector and update is a function that applies a function a vector in the indice passing as parameter, and returns that vector with the values update, I also started programming clojure book. to go deep
in the language.

## Day 6: SEP 25, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I learned about some important functions on clojure that are map, filter and reduce and how just tree function we can do a lot of things, also kept my read of book programing clojure, learn about forms and keywords to use theses things to improve our code.

## Day 7: SEP 26, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept me reading  the book programing clojure, It is a great book to get the foundation of  clojure, Because I learn more about functions, reader macros, things that I haven't seen, also practice a little, testing do some functions with map, filter e reduce to memorize in my head.

## Day 8: SEP 27, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I practice a little about how define maps/dictionaries and did some to fix in my mind.

## Day 9: SEP 28, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I studie about thread(first and last) in clojure, in which case use each one, and learned about destructuring, and how these helps when we want extract the value to individual variables in one step.This technique is particularly useful when you want to conveniently access specific parts of a complex data structure.

Destructuring is often used in function parameters, where you can destructure the arguments passed to the function to access the values ​​directly. Additionally, it is commonly used in maps to extract values ​​associated with specific keys.
