## Day 1: SEP 18, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I started a Clojure formation on Alura, so the first class I saw about the syntax of language, and how to define symbols that are similar to global variables in other languages, also saw a bit about immutability.

## Day 2: SEP 19, 2023

- **Today`s Progress**: Today I kept watching the clojure course, so in this class I learn about how can I create my functions using the key **defn**, and how pass parameters, and to finalize I saw about patterns to write code on clojure.
