# Clojure 



### Why Clojure

- Is a functional language, so it's simple to understand, and isolate calculation from state and identity.

- Lisp is simple, it separates reading from evaluation, and
the language is made  from a tiny number of orthogonal partsp.

- Lisp is also powerful, providing a compiler and macro system at runtime.

- Clojureâ€™s time model is simple, separating values, identities, state, and time.

- Protocols are simple, separating polymorphism from derivation.
